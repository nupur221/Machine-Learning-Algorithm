-------- About KNN --------

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) :

An algorithm — it’s a simple, intuitive method for classification or regression that finds the k closest data points (neighbors) in the training set to a new point and predicts based on them.
A model — once trained (which basically means storing the training data), it can be used to predict new samples. So it acts like a model in practice.

How KNN works:

Training: KNN “training” is just memorizing the dataset — no real fitting or parameter learning happens.
Prediction: For a new data point, it calculates distances to all training points, picks the k closest, and uses their labels to classify or regress.
..........  So, KNN is an algorithm for doing nearest neighbor search, and the object you get after training is considered a model you can use for prediction.
